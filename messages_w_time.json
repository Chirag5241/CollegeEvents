We will be using the club chess sets for the tryouts today, so please make sure to bring your own boards and clocks. Feel free to play whoever or organize whatever you want.\n\n2) Thursday tryouts: If you played your rapid games on Thursday but didn\u2019t have time to complete the puzzles portion, feel free to show up at Illini Union Room A.

We recommend bringing your own chess boards in case we don\u2019t have enough chess boards to distribute to everyone. In the last club meeting, we ran a blitz tournament and it went fairly smoothly. We may try and do another blitz tournament for this club meeting. Also, we hope there are 20 tables with 80 chairs in the room this time. Last time there were only 8 tables even though we asked for enough to seat 80 people... oh well. If there are too few tables again, some or all of us may have to go to the basement or play on the floor. Hopefully that won\u2019t happen though.\n\n**2) Rated Tournament:** Hypothetically speaking, would you participate in a rated tournament with a classical time control format (such as 50-60 minutes each side with some increment)? See the poll we just created in the #polls text channel. There are lots of variables and technicalities to get sorted out so we cannot provide all of the details yet. Assume in the worst case scenario that you would have to pay for your own USCF membership and a small entry fee, although we do not anticipate the entry fee being high at all if it exists.\n\n**3) Campuslabs:** You may have asked if you are a part of the chess club when you first joined this Discord server. Well, yes and technically no. Yes in the sense that anyone can come to our club meetings and play. No in the sense that in order to technically be a part of the chess club, you need to join our club at https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/illinichessclub and click the \u201cJoin\u201d button. I think it should be that simple. Please inform us if it isn\u2019t though, and we\u2019ll edit this announcement.

When we get the link to the tourney, we\u2019ll post it in the CCL discord text channel later. It should occur at noon. Also, we received news that chess.com is giving away diamond memberships for each team we signed up for CCL, so we should discuss who gets the diamond memberships at some point. We encourage discussing this in the CCL discord text channel. \n\n**3) Chess.com Club:** Feel free to join our club on chess.com: https://www.chess.com/l/illinoisillini. This club is tied with CCL, in a sense that the University club which has the most members who join their chess.com club during the CCL season will get a $500 prize.

As the deadline to sign up approaches, we constantly think of more ways to incentivize more participation in this tournament. After careful consideration and reflection, we have decided to include an element of risk and excitement into this tournament. The logic is simple. We have already pandered toward people who are risk averse, since chess in general is a safe game. We haven\u2019t considered those who enjoy risk, who do dangerous things because they like dancing on the fine line which separates life and death.\n\nTaking all of this into account, we have decided to add an additional prize for these danger-chasing individuals. At the end of the tournament, one person from the open and the reserve section will be randomly chosen to be executed via explosive decapitation in the center of the main quad on campus. By this, we mean that tiny explosive cartridges will be meticulously placed around the prize-winners\u2019 necks and they will all be detonated simultaneously.", "@everyone Just another reminder that the chess club meeting today is from 3-5 pm in room 404 of the Illini Union.

After each candidate for the position has gone, the candidates will leave the call so that everyone else can deliberate. Once deliberations are over, an anonymous Google Form will be sent out in the Zoom call, and the winner for that position will be announced. Rinse and repeat for the other positions. If this is confusing, don't worry! We'll be going over this more in depth at the beginning of the election meeting as well.\n\nThe nomination process is as follows:\n- There are 4 elected positions: Chair, Vice-Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary; you can find descriptions of the roles here (under \u201cOfficers\u201d): https://bit.ly/3pmfDl9\n\n- If you would like to nominate someone (or yourself) for a position, send an email to cding20@illinois.edu formally nominating the candidate for the position (make sure to cc the candidate and mention the position if you are nominating someone other than yourself). All nominations will be tracked here: https://bit.ly/3jP5P1Z\n\n- If you are running for a position and do not win, you do have the ability to run for one of the lower positions (e.g. you don\u2019t win the chair election, you can run for vice chair, and if you don\u2019t win that you can run for treasurer, etc.)\n\n- You must be a paid ACM@UIUC member in order to run or vote.\n\nNominations are due March 24th before 11:59PM central time. Please send any of the current ACM Exec Board a message if you have any questions. ACM Exec Board is a great opportunity to give back to the organization and CS@Illinois.

To enable research and development in this area, we have built ILLIXR \u2013 Illinois Extended Reality tested \u2013 the first open source XR system and testbed for XR systems research and development. We have also launched the ILLIXR consortium, an industry backed consortium to democratize XR systems research, development, and benchmarking by creating a reference XR testbed based on ILLIXR, a benchmarking methodology, and a multidisciplinary XR systems research community. Using ILLIXR, we have provided the first published results on performance/power/quality of an end-to-end XR system. These results show that systems of the next decade require, and ILLIXR enables, application-driven, end-to-end quality-of-experience driven, and hardware-software-application co-designed systems research.

First off, thanks to all of you who came out to Quad Day this past Sunday! It was wonderful to see so many of you there in person and put faces to some names! \nOne thing I wanted to put on your radar was our new mailing list! I'll try to send out most updates on Discord and the mailing list so we have a two-way channel for questions, but sign up for some more condensed month to month updates! You can sign up here https://groups.webservices.illinois.edu/subscribe/148826\nThe second thing I wanted to bring to your attention is our first general member event of the semester coming up soon!  Our SSC Open House will be held on** September 8th, at 5 pm CT at the freshly constructed Campus Instructional Facility**! It's a really cool location, so I hope that I'll be able to meet some of you in person, but alternatively, we're planning to offer an online event at the same time. More details to follow on that in the future (I just haven't made the Zoom link yet lol). This event will be a good opportunity to learn a bit about SSC if you're newly involved, but more importantly, it represents an opportunity to decide what capacity you want to be involved with SSC this semester (e.g., outreach/comms, Energy stuff, working in the community, all three of those, etc.). If you have a very broad OR a very narrow interest in sustainability (or even something in between), this will be a good event for deciding what you want to do in SSC!\nThe final thing I wanted to bring to your attention is not an SSC event, although we are an affiliate group! The Reimagine Our Future competition gives student teams the opportunity to devise a plan/solution that addresses one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. You can find more info here https://reimagine.web.illinois.edu/ and register to participate by September 20th! \nThat's all!

Everyone sign up!\n\n\nHey Student Sustainability Committee members,\n\nJeff Yockey of Champaign County Bikes here.  Tomorrow is Bike to Work Day in Champaign County where we encourage everyone to ride their bikes to work. And for college students, being a student is your calling and work at the moment, so all of you count as bike commuters!\n\nChampaign County Bikes and the CC Bike Month steering committee would love it if all of you signed up tonight, and gave one of your bike friends a nudge to sign up as well. We are at 760 registration as of 9:40 pm and really want to get over 800 tonight.  800 would be an all time Bike to Work Day record and nearly twice as many as 2019!  Having that many folks registered would give us as local bicycle advocates so much leverage as we campaign for lower speed limits on neighborhood streets, more bicycle infrastructure (like all the new roadway design on Green and Wright streets), more bike parking, increase the number of people who cycle to work, etc.\n\nThe link to sign up is here   http://cubikemonth.weebly.com/bike-to-work-day.html\n\nWe have nine (9!!) welcome stations on campus, so just pick one close by.  They will be open from 7am-10am tomorrow and have some breakfast snack food, cycling literature, maps,  and of course, our cool Bike Month t-shirts.  So you can just grab your bike in the morning and pedal on over!\n\n\n\nPlease take one minute to sign up, and then another minute or two to forward this email on to a cycling friend of yours and encourage them to quick register too.  \n\nThanks again,\n\nJeff", "Hey, you all care about the planet.

Please make sure to read this entire important message.\n\nSome of our chess clocks have been going missing. We started the fall semester with around 10 or so chess clocks and last time we checked our duffel bag we now only have 3. If you accidentally or intentionally have taken one of our chess clocks, we would greatly appreciate if you returned them. If you look around your room or search your backpack, see a chess clock with a piece of tape on the back of the clock, and think \u201chuh, I don\u2019t remember purchasing or even having this\u201d, then there is a possibility that it could be one of ours.\n\nThe next chess club meeting is on Sunday April 3rd from 3-5 pm in room 404 of the Illini Union. We hope to see you there if you\u2019re able to make it! There will not be a club meeting on April 10th because of the Champaign chess championship.\n\nThe Champaign chess championship is the first chess tournament at UIUC in a long time. As the deadline to sign up approaches, we constantly think of more ways to incentivize more participation in this tournament. After careful consideration and reflection, we have decided to include an element of risk and excitement into this tournament. The logic is simple. We have already pandered toward people who are risk averse, since chess in general is a safe game. We haven\u2019t considered those who enjoy risk, who do dangerous things because they like dancing on the fine line which separates life and death.\n\nTaking all of this into account, we have decided to add an additional prize for these danger-chasing individuals. At the end of the tournament, one person from the open and the reserve section will be randomly chosen to be executed via explosive decapitation in the center of the main quad on campus. By this, we mean that tiny explosive cartridges will be meticulously placed around the prize-winners\u2019 necks and they will all be detonated simultaneously.", "@everyone Just another reminder that the chess club meeting today is from 3-5 pm in room 404 of the Illini Union.

From this generalized framework, I will derive some of the recently proposed approaches to sequence generation beyond conventional left-to-right monotonic generation. They include parallel decoding via iterative refinement, latent-variable non-autoregressive sequence models, masked language model generation and non-monotonic sequential generation.\n\nBio: Kyunghyun Cho is an associate professor of computer science and data science at New York University and a research scientist at Facebook AI Research. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Montreal until summer 2015 under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio, and received PhD and MSc degrees from Aalto University early 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Juha Karhunen, Dr. Tapani Raiko and Dr. Alexander Ilin. He tries his best to find a balance among machine learning, natural language processing, and life, but almost always fails to do so.", "Prof. Shosted will hold a discussion about applying for graduate studies in linguistics next Wednesday, 6-7 pm.

Joe is Co-Founder of Ocient and has started and sold three other companies. Ocient is planning on raising its series C round in early 2023, which should put it into Unicorn status. Ocient has built a scalable data warehouse platform that is designed to hold hundreds of petabytes of data and return results in interactive time.

On the one hand, emerging hardware break long-held system design principles and are held back by aged and inflexible system interfaces and usage models, requiring radical rethinking on the software stack to leverage new hardware capabilities for optimal performance. On the other hand, the computing landscape is becoming increasingly heterogeneous and complex, demanding explicit systems-level support to manage hardware-associated complexity and idiosyncrasy, which is unfortunately still largely missing.\nIn this talk, I will discuss my efforts to build low-latency and cost-efficient datacenter storage systems. By revisiting existing storage interface/abstraction designs and software/hardware responsibility divisions, I will present holistic storage stack designs for cloud datacenters, which deliver orders of magnitude of latency improvement and significantly improved cost-efficiency.\n \n*Bio: Huaicheng is a postdoc at CMU in the Parallel Data Lab (PDL). He received his Ph.D. from University of Chicago. His interests are mainly in Operating Systems and Storage Systems, with a focus on building high-performance and cost-efficient storage infrastructure for datacenters.

However, the amount of engineering effort and domain knowledge required for scaling up ML is often underestimated. The marginal cost for developing specialized systems with hand-tuned parallel strategies is extremely high in the face of emerging models and heterogeneous cluster setups.\n\nIn this talk, I will present a better way to build better ML systems. I view ML system building as an optimation over a parallel strategy space, with the objective of maximizing the system \u201cgoodput\u201d, conditioned on model and cluster configurations. I show that by formulating each piece in the optimization as math representations, we can make it solvable using existing tools. Unlike specialized systems, this formulation enables building generic ML compilers that automate ML parallelization, generalize to many models, and achieve strong performance, simultaneously. In particular, I\u2019ll describe two compiler systems: Alpa and Cavs, which automate model parallelism on large-scale distributed clusters, and the batching of dynamic neural network computation on accelerators, respectively. My open-source artifacts have been used by organizations such as AI2, Meta, and Google, and parts of my research have been commercialized at multiple start-ups including Petuum and AnyScale.\n\nBio: Hao Zhang is a postdoc researcher at UC Berkeley working with Ion Stoica. He completed his Ph.D. at CMU where he worked with Eric Xing. His research interests are in the intersection of machine learning and systems, with the focus on improving the performance and ease-of-use of today\u2019s distributed ML systems. Hao\u2019s research has been recognized with an NVIDIA pioneer research award at NeurIPS\u201917, and the Jay Lepreau best paper award at OSDI\u201921.\n\nPassword: csillinois", "I am going to aim now to host the information session at 4:30 pm central time, this Friday 2/12/21.
